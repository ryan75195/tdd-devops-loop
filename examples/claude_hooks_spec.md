# Claude Code Hooks Integration Specification

## Overview
Add the ability to configure and execute Claude Code hooks for agents in the agentic pipeline framework. This will allow agents to integrate with user-defined shell commands that execute in response to specific agent events, enabling custom workflows and integrations.

## Requirements

### Hook Configuration
- Agents should support configurable hooks that execute shell commands at specific lifecycle events
- Hook configuration should be definable in agent config files and CLI parameters
- Support multiple hooks per event type with execution order control
- Hooks should inherit the agent's working directory and environment variables
- Configuration should support both global hooks (all agents) and agent-specific hooks

### Supported Hook Events
- `pre_initialization`: Before agent initialization begins
- `post_initialization`: After agent initialization completes successfully
- `pre_iteration`: Before each agent iteration starts
- `post_iteration`: After each agent iteration completes
- `on_error`: When agent encounters an error or exception
- `pre_finalization`: Before agent finalization begins
- `post_finalization`: After agent finalization completes
- `on_terminal`: When agent reaches terminal condition

### Hook Execution Environment
- Hooks should execute in the same working directory as the agent
- Environment variables should include agent context (name, type, iteration count)
- Hook output (stdout/stderr) should be captured and logged appropriately
- Hook execution should have configurable timeout limits (default 30 seconds)
- Failed hooks should not terminate agent execution unless explicitly configured

### Hook Configuration Format
- YAML configuration file support for complex hook definitions
- CLI parameter support for simple hook commands
- Environment variable substitution in hook commands
- Conditional hook execution based on agent state or results
- Hook command templating with agent context variables

### Security and Safety
- Hook commands should be validated to prevent obvious security issues
- Support for restricted execution environments or sandboxing
- Audit logging of all hook executions with timestamps and results
- Option to disable hooks entirely for security-sensitive environments
- Hook command allow/deny lists for enterprise environments

### Integration Points
- Hook system should integrate cleanly with existing agent lifecycle
- Hooks should not interfere with agent state management
- Hook failures should be handled gracefully without breaking agent flow
- Support for asynchronous hook execution where appropriate
- Integration with existing logging and error reporting systems

### Performance Requirements
- Hook execution should not significantly impact agent performance
- Parallel hook execution where possible and safe
- Hook execution time should be tracked and reported
- Resource usage monitoring for hook processes
- Configurable limits on concurrent hook executions

## Technical Constraints
- Must work with existing agentic pipeline framework
- Should integrate with current agent base classes and interfaces
- Must support both Python subprocess and Claude Code SDK execution contexts
- Should work across different operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Configuration should be backward compatible with existing agent configs

## Success Criteria
- Agents can register and execute hooks at all supported lifecycle events
- Hook configuration is flexible and supports multiple formats
- Hook execution is secure, logged, and doesn't break agent functionality
- Performance impact is minimal and measurable
- Integration is seamless with existing agent implementations
- Documentation and examples are provided for common hook patterns
