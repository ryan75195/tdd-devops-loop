# User Authentication System Specification

## Overview
We need to implement a secure user authentication system that allows users to register, login, and manage their sessions. The system should support email/password authentication with proper security measures.

## Requirements

### User Registration
- Users can register with email address and password
- Email addresses must be unique in the system
- Password must meet security requirements (minimum 8 characters, include uppercase, lowercase, number)
- Email verification should be sent after registration
- Users cannot login until email is verified

### User Login
- Users can login with verified email and password
- System should track failed login attempts
- Account should be temporarily locked after 5 consecutive failed attempts (30 minute lockout)
- Successful login creates a JWT session token valid for 24 hours
- Users should be redirected to dashboard after successful login

### Session Management
- JWT tokens should include user ID and expiration time
- Tokens should be refreshable up to 7 days from original issue
- Users should be able to logout (invalidate their token)
- System should handle concurrent sessions (multiple devices)
- Sessions should expire automatically after inactivity period

### Password Recovery
- Users can request password reset via email
- Reset links should expire after 1 hour
- Users should be able to set new password using valid reset link
- Password reset should invalidate all existing sessions
- System should log all password reset attempts

### Security Features
- All passwords must be hashed using bcrypt with salt
- Rate limiting on login attempts (max 10 per minute per IP)
- SQL injection prevention in all database queries
- XSS protection in all user inputs
- HTTPS required for all authentication endpoints
- Audit logging for all authentication events

### Integration Points
- Must integrate with existing user profile system
- Should work with existing email service for notifications
- Must be compatible with existing database schema
- API should follow RESTful conventions

## Technical Constraints
- Backend: Python with existing framework
- Database: Use existing PostgreSQL database
- Email: Integrate with current email service
- Frontend: Must work with existing JavaScript application
- Performance: Login should complete within 2 seconds
- Availability: 99.9% uptime requirement

## Success Criteria
- All user registration flows work correctly
- Login/logout functionality is secure and reliable
- Password reset process is user-friendly
- System meets all security requirements
- Performance targets are achieved
- Integration with existing systems is seamless
